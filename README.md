# US_shootings_hypothesis_contrast

Hello everyone!! In this repository you'll find a R markdown with a contrast hypothesis on US shooting incidents. We'll look for statistical differences on two independent samples and learn how to:

* Clean and tranform data
* Summarize and graphically represent grouped data
* Check for normality assumptions
* Test for statisticaly significant differences between independent samples
